# Ideas


- Improve exploration: Something like Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM).
- Transportation module: goal is at a short distance (given by the local planner for the object's path) and limited by a virtual corridor.
- Mapless navigation => There are good non-learning algorithms that we should use instead of RL.
    - The only motivation for RL: sparse sensor data. => We can probably update the methods for this.


Planar pushing:
Goals:
- Application scenarios
- How to perceive the object? => improve what we are using.
- Model based RL?
    => Can we learn the model like Bauza? => small set of latent variables.
    => Advantages?
